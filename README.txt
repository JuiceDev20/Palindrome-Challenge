Palindrome Challenge

Another great challenge from Coder Foundry, you are putting me through the paces but I am learning tons.

Good exercise to learn how to create functions that can reverse a string sequence. 
This challenge was fun. 

Anyway, hope you like using it and please feel free to share your thoughts.
