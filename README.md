#### Palindrome Challenge
![](/Images/PalindromeChallenge.png)

Good exercise to learn how to create functions that can reverse a string, this challenge was fun. 

**Palindrome** is defined as a word, phrase, number or sequence of words that reads the same whether one reads it forward (left-to-right) or backwards (right-to-left). The most common of English palindromes are those that are read character by character, for instance: "Mom", "level," "rotor," and â€œrace car".

Character by character means that each character of the word matches and the word can be spelled the same forwards or backward. The word palindrome is derived from the Greek ***'palin'*** or "back" and ***'dromos'*** or "direction." The actual Greek phrase alluded to the backward movement of the crab.

Anyway, I hope you learn something new and please feel free to share your thoughts. 

Enjoy your day!
